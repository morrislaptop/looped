# Release Notes

## Versioning Scheme

As a starter kit, looped does not have versioning. Simply follow the notes in [installation](installation) to get the latest starter!

All packages included in the starter kit will follow semantic versioning to ensure your application doesn't break. 

## Support Policy

Please file issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/morrislaptop/looped/issues).
