# Contribution Guide

## Bug Reports

To encourage active collaboration, Looped strongly encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test.

Since looped pulls in third party packages, in most cases, bugs should be reported at the source repo for that package. 

## Which Branch?

**All** bug fixes should be sent to the `master` branch.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Looped, please send an email to Craig Morris at <a href="mailto:craig.michael.morris@gmail.com">craig.michael.morris@gmail.com</a>. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Coding Style

Looped follows the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) format and [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) linter.
